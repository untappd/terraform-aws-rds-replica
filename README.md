# terraform-aws-rds-replica [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica.svg)](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica/releases/latest) [![Slack Community](https://slack.cloudposse.com/badge.svg)](https://slack.cloudposse.com)


Terraform module to provision AWS [`RDS`](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) replica instances. These are best suited for reporting purposes.

**IMPORTANT** It is not possible to create a read replica for a DB Instance that belongs to an Aurora DB Cluster.

It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).







We literally have [*hundreds of terraform modules*][terraform_modules] that are Open Source and well-maintained. Check them out! 






## Introduction

The module will create an RDS replica instance:

* RDS Replica instance (MySQL, Postgres, SQL Server, Oracle)
* RDS Subnet Group
* RDS DB Security Group
* DNS Record in Route53 for the DB endpoint

## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica/releases).


```hcl
module "rds_replica" {
  source                      = "git::https://github.com/cloudposse/terraform-aws-rds-replica.git?ref=master"
  namespace                   = "eg"
  stage                       = "prod"
  name                        = "reporting"
  replicate_source_db         = "eg-prod-db
  dns_zone_id                 = "Z89FN1IW975KPE"
  host_name                   = "reporting"
  security_group_ids          = ["sg-xxxxxxxx"]
  database_port               = 3306
  multi_az                    = "true"
  storage_type                = "gp2"
  storage_encrypted           = "true"
  instance_class              = "db.t2.medium"
  publicly_accessible         = "false"
  subnet_ids                  = ["subnet-xxxxxxxxx", "subnet-xxxxxxxxx"]
  vpc_id                      = "vpc-xxxxxxxx"
  auto_minor_version_upgrade  = "true"
  allow_major_version_upgrade = "false"
  apply_immediately           = "false"
  maintenance_window          = "Mon:03:00-Mon:04:00"
  skip_final_snapshot         = "false"
  copy_tags_to_snapshot       = "true"
  backup_retention_period     = 7
  backup_window               = "22:00-03:00"
}
```
